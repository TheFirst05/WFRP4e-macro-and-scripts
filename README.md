# First WFRP4e macros and scripts
This is a collection of macros & scripts we use at our table. Almost always "Work in Progress" as I learn and improve.

* Sober up
* Outfit Equipper
* Outfit Equipper config
* Assess
* Check Bleeding and Poisoned
* Remedy Generator
* Better Pursuits
* Heal wounds

## Time Gentlemen Alcohol Macro
A streamlined drinking mechanic of the excellent "Time Gentlemen Please" Homebrew by Braille Knight on the Rat Catcher's Guild. Automates adding drunkeness effects, as well as the various Alcohol buff effects based on the drink you consume. Thanks to Pallando for the original Consume Alcohol macro.
## Sober up Macro 
Automates the removal of Drunkedness (and Alcohol Effects if any) and gives Hangovers once enough time has elapsed (requires Time's Up and a calendar module to function).
## Outfit Equipper and Outfit Equipper Config
These two macros work together. Use the config macro to create up to 3 outfits. Once assigned, use the Outfit Equipper to swap between different worn clothes and trappings. Macro based of the work from Bolt on the RCG discord, who did a version for armour.
## Assess Macro
Requires Group Advantage and the GM's Toolkit module. Automatically rolls intuition and increases advantage by the correct amount on a success. (doesn't increase over 10).
## Check Bleeding and Poisoned
Checks if selected NPC tokens fall unconscious or not if they are bleeding and on 0 wounds (checks for Poisoned as well, since we homebrewed it that way).
## Remedy Generator
Creates a randomised symptom remedy item that players can buy or drag onto their character sheets. A message in the GM notes tells the GM if the remedy is genuine or not. Prices are a very rough estimate.
## Better Pursuits Macro
Calculates and tells you how far you run with the Complex Pursuit rules. 
## Heal wounds macro
Creates a message that informs the players how many wounds they heal on a successful Heal Test.
