# First WFRP4e macros and scripts
This is a collection of macros & scripts we use at our table.
## Time Gentlemen Alcohol Macro
A streamlined drinking mechanic of the excellent "Time Gentlemen Please" Homebrew by Braille Knight on the Rat Catcher's Guild. Automates adding drunkeness effects, as well as the various Alcohol buff effects based on the drink you consume. Thanks to Pallando for the original Consume Alcohol macro.
## Sober up Macro 
Automates the removal of Drunkedness (and Alcohol Effects if any) and gives Hangovers once enough time has elapsed (requires Time's Up and a calendar module to function).
## Remedy Generator
Creates a randomised symptom remedy item that players can buy or drag onto their character sheets. A message in the GM notes tells the GM if the remedy is genuine or not. Prices are a very rough estimate.
## Heal wounds macro
Creates a message that informs the players how many wounds they heal on a successful Heal Test.
## Check Bleeding and Poisoned
Checks if selected NPC tokens fall unconscious or not if they are bleeding and on 0 wounds (checks for Poisoned as well, since we homebrewed it that way).
