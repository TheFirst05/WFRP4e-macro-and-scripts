# First WFRP4e macros and scripts
This is a collection of macros & scripts we use at our table.
## Time Gentlemen Alcohol Macro:
A streamlined drinking mechanic of the excellent "Time Gentlemen Please" Homebrew by Braille Knight on the Rat Catcher's Guild.
## Sober up Macro 
Automates the removal of Drunkedness (and Alcohol Effects) and giving Hangovers once enough time has elapsed (requires Time's Up and a calendar module to function).
## Remedy Generator
Creates a randomised symptom remedy item that players can buy or drag onto their character sheets. A message in the GM notes tells the GM if the remedy is genuine or not.
## Heal wounds macro
Creates a message that informs the players how many wounds they heal on a successful Heal Test.
## Check Bleeding and Poisoned
Checks if selected NPC tokens fall unconscious or not if they are bleeding and on 0 wounds (or poisoned, houserule).
